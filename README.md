Introduction
-------------

This is a social media application I created for fun! I wanted to gain a better understanding how to program an application while utilizing the MERN stack. This application allows user within an organization to create posts otherwise known as Chords. Users can like, comment and share each others chords.

Setup
-------------

<p>Installation of MongoDB, React Native, Expo and Nodejs</p>
<p>Understanding of MongoDB, Nodejs, React Native and a bit of GraphQL</p>

 1. ```$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/dannjoku1/MyCircle.git```  
 2. Run ```$ mongod``` & ```$ mongo``` from your root directory to initiate MongoDB.
 3. ```$ cd server``` & ```$ npm run dev``` or ```$ yarn dev``` to start up the server.
 4. ```$ cd ../``` then ```$ cd mobile``` (this is where the client resides).
 5. ```$ exp start``` to start expo tunnel.
 6. ```$ exp run-ios``` or ```$ exp run-android``` to start the application interface.
